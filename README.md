# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
This application was built as a way to allow freelance web developers to create simple logos for their clients and projects so that they can forego paying a graphic designer. It utilizes inquirer to prompt the user within the command line for how they would like their logo to look with what text they would like their logo to display (up to 3 characters in length), the color of that text, the shape of their logo (triangle, square, or circle) and the color of that shape. Once the user answers all prompts, then an SVG file is written using their selections to generate a logo.

## Installation
You have to install node and you must use an npm install before you are able to use the logo maker

## Features
Features of this application include the users ability to generate logos quickly and easily through the use of SVG files, entirely from the command line. No UI (user interface) needed, and no front end tools needed.
